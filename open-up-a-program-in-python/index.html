How to open open up run a program file folder in Python programming language?
This is nice, we use os module.
```
import os
os.startfile("yourprogram.exe")
```
Yay! That's good. Let's run a not exe!
```
import os
os.startfile("yourpy.py")
```
Maybe, program not in this directory. Then: 
```
import os
os.startfile(r"C:\yourdirectory\yourpy.py")
```
Wooow NICE!
